## CI/CD Plan

![nice image showing the CI/CD play](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ibsu7Nvvd9gyhHxO.png)

The plan is to have Travis CI run tests and, if they pass, build the files when a commit is done to the master branch. Travis will then deploy the built files to github pages for hosting.
